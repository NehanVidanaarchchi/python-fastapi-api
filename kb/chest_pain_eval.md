# Chest Pain – Initial Evaluation (Educational)

- Typical angina or chest pain during exertion → urgent clinical assessment.
- Obtain ECG and consider serial troponin per local protocol.
- If red flags (rest pain, syncope, dyspnea at rest, hemodynamic instability), escalate emergency care.
- Risk stratify (history, ECG, vitals, risk factors) and avoid strenuous activity until reviewed.
- Consider stress testing or imaging based on clinician judgment and availability.
